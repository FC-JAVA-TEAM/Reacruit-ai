IMPORTANT:  
- Filter based on extracted criteria from JD before analyzing.  
- Be strict on filtering.  
- Avoid assumptions.
- If the job description is vague or lacks specific requirements, be more lenient in your filtering but note this in your analysis.
- For complex job descriptions with multiple requirements, clearly explain which requirements the candidate meets and which they don't.
